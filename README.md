### Sprint Review

  - All initial sprint goals were successfully completed.
  - Significant developments included learning Unity Cloud integration and writing character control from scratch.
  - Despite issues with animation integration and asset research, the project continues to progress.
  - Research was conducted for ready-made assets, but since no suitable free assets were found, models were created with Blender to maintain visual integrity.
  - A new input system was adopted as a more sustainable and useful solution for the project.
  - Future sprints will involve more detailed planning of animation processes, reinforcement of Unity Cloud usage, and increased game testing.
